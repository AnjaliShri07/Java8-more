/**
 * A group of students is sitting in a circle. The teacher is electing a new class president.
 * The teacher does this by singing a song while walking around the circle. After the song is
 * finished the student at which the teacher stopped is removed from the circle.
 * Starting at the student next to the one that was just removed, the teacher resumes singing and walking around the circle.
 * After the teacher is done singing, the next student is removed. The teacher repeats this until only one student is left.
 * A song of length k will result in the teacher walking past k students on each round. The students are numbered 1 to n. The teacher starts at student 1.
 * For example, suppose the song length is two (k=2). And there are four students to start with (1,2,3,4). The first
 * student to go would be `2`, after that `4`, and after that `3`. Student `1` would be the next president in this example.
 * @param n the number of students sitting in a circle.
 * @param k the length (in students) of each song.
 * @return the number of the student that is elected.

/*üîç Explanation:
IntStream.rangeClosed(1, n) creates a stream of student numbers 1 to n.
.boxed().collect(Collectors.toList()) converts the IntStream to a List<Integer>.
The main logic runs a loop:
Compute next removal index using (index + k - 1) % size
Remove the student at that index
Repeat until one student remains.*/
