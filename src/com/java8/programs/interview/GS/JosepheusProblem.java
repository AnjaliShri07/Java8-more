/*The Josephus Problem is a theoretical problem related to a certain elimination game.
People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds
around the circle in a fixed direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed.
This process is repeated with the remaining people until only one person remains and is freed.
The problem is to choose the position in the initial circle to avoid execution.*/
