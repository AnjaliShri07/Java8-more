Problem -
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

🔍 Problem Summary
You are given height[i], which represents a vertical line from (i, 0) to (i, height[i]).
You need to find two lines such that they, along with the x-axis, form a container holding the maximum area of water.

✅ Intuition:
The area between two lines is:

Area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
To maximize this area, start with the left and right ends, and move inward.

🧠 Why Move the Shorter Line?
The area is constrained by the shorter height.
To potentially find a taller line (and thus a larger area), move the shorter pointer inward.
