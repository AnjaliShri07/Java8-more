âœ… APPROACHES TO SHORTEST PATH IN AN UNWEIGHTED GRAPH

Method	Description	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
Breadth-First Search (BFS)	Best for unweighted graphs	O(V + E)	O(V)
Dijkstra's Algorithm	For weighted graphs	O((V + E) log V)	O(V)
ðŸ‘‰ Since your train map has no weights (all paths are equal), BFS is the optimal approach.

ðŸ”„ OTHER POSSIBLE APPROACHES

Approach	When to Use
Dijkstra's	If stations had travel times or weights
A Search*	If you had heuristics (like geolocation)
DFS	Not suitable for shortest path (may go deep unnecessarily)
Would you like:

To see this with weights/travel time (Dijkstra)?

To visualize multiple paths or all possible routes?

To return the number of hops or distance?
