Problem -
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively,
return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

üîç How It Works (Binary Search Partitioning)
We try to partition both arrays such that:

Left part of combined arrays contains half of the total elements

All elements in left part are less than those in the right part

We binary search on the smaller array to find the correct partition.
