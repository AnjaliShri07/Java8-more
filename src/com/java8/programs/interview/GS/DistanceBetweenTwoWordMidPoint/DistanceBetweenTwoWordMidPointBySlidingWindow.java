/*Alternative Approach 2: Using Sliding Window for Optimization
This approach uses the sliding window technique to minimize space complexity and avoid storing all midpoints.
By sliding through the document, we can update the minimum distance directly as we find both word1 and word2 in sequence.

Steps:
Slide through the document to find occurrences of word1 and word2.
Track the most recent position of word1 and word2.

Every time both are found, compute the distance between their midpoints and update the minimum distance.

Distance Calculation: Every time we find both words, we calculate the distance between their midpoints and update
the shortest distance if necessary.

Time Complexity:
Sliding through the document: O(n) where n is the length of the document.
Distance Calculation Complexity: O(1) for each pair of occurrences.

Space Complexity:
Space Complexity: O(1) as we only need a few variables to track the most recent occurrences of the words.
