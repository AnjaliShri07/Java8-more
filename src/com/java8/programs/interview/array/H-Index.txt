Problem -
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for
their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index. According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least
h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1

âœ… Steps to Calculate H-Index
Sort the array in descending order.

Iterate through the sorted array.

For each paper at index i, check if citations[i] >= i + 1.

The last valid i + 1 is the h-index.
